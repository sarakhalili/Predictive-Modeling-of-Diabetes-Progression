# Predictive-Modeling-of-Diabetes-Progression-Using-Regression-Analysis-

**Introduction**

This report provides a detailed analysis of the UCI Diabetes Dataset, focusing on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and regression analysis. The primary goal of this project is to understand the factors influencing diabetes progression through various stages of data analysis, ultimately leading to the development of predictive models.
I obtained the UCI Diabetes Dataset from a reliable source. Once I had the dataset, I loaded it into my data analysis environment using pandas. I conducted an initial exploration of the data to familiarize myself with its structure and content. This involved examining the first few rows of the dataset, checking for missing values, and understanding the distribution and types of each feature. This exploratory analysis helped me identify any anomalies or patterns that might influence subsequent steps.

## 1.	Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing was a critical step to ensure the data was clean and suitable for modeling. I addressed any missing values by removing affected rows, depending on the extent of missing data. I also performed feature engineering to create or modify features that could enhance the model's performance. Additionally, I standardized the features to ensure they were on a similar scale, which is especially important for algorithms sensitive to feature scaling.
### 1.1 Importing Necessary Libraries
•	Reasoning: Essential libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn were imported to facilitate data manipulation, numerical operations, and visualization. These libraries provide robust tools required for efficient data preprocessing and analysis.
### 1.2 Loading the Dataset
•	Reasoning: The dataset was loaded from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame using pd.read_csv(). This method provides a structured approach to data handling, allowing for easy manipulation and analysis.
### 1.3 Checking for Missing Values
•	Reasoning: Missing values can lead to inaccuracies in subsequent analyses and models. The code utilizes isnull().sum() to check for missing values across all columns, which is critical for identifying data quality issues that need addressing.
### 1.4 Handling Missing Values
•	Reasoning: Rows containing missing values were dropped using dropna(inplace=True). This approach ensures that only complete data is used for analysis, thereby maintaining the integrity of the dataset. Although other methods like imputation could be used, dropping rows was deemed appropriate for this analysis.
### 1.5 Data Type Conversions
•	Reasoning: Consistent and correct data types are crucial for accurate calculations and operations. The following conversions were performed:
o	The 'date' column was converted to datetime format to enable time-based operations.
o	The 'time' column was converted to datetime format and the hour was extracted for time-based analysis.
o	The 'code' column was converted to an integer to ensure uniformity.
o	The 'value' column was converted to numeric to facilitate mathematical operations and comparisons.
### 1.6 Loading Cleaned Data (if necessary)
•	Reasoning: If the dataset was already cleaned, the code reloads the cleaned version from a different file path, saving time and avoiding redundant preprocessing steps.
### 1.7 Date and Time Formatting
•	Reasoning: Consistent formatting of 'date' and 'time' columns (MM/DD/YYYY for dates and 12-hour format for times) ensures standardization. This step is critical for accurate interpretation and time-based analysis.
### 1.8 Mapping Codes to Descriptive Names
•	Reasoning: Numeric codes were mapped to descriptive names using a dictionary, creating a new 'code_name' column. This improves the readability and interpretability of the data, facilitating meaningful analysis and visualization.
### 1.9 Creating Separate Tables
•	Reasoning: The data was filtered into separate tables for different categories (blood glucose levels, insulin doses, daily ingestion, physical activity, and hypoglycemic symptoms). This categorization allows for targeted and focused analysis of each data subset.
### 1.10 Removing Outliers
•	Reasoning: Outliers can distort results and lead to incorrect conclusions. The code defines a function to remove outliers using an IQR-based method with a multiplier of 3, focusing on extreme values that could disproportionately influence the analysis.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
### 2.1 Summary Statistics
•	Reasoning: Summary statistics were generated using the describe() method, providing an overview of each category in the dataset. Metrics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles offer insights into the distribution, central tendency, and variability of the data.

### 2.2 Visualizations
•	Reasoning: Visualizations are key to understanding data distribution and spread.
o	Histograms and KDE plots: These plots show the frequency distribution and shape of the data (e.g., normal, skewed).
o	Box plots: These highlight the spread, central tendency, and outliers within the data, facilitating comparisons across different categories.

### 2.3 Histograms with Statistics
•	Reasoning: Enhanced histograms with mean, median, and standard deviation lines provide a statistical context, aiding in the quick identification of central tendency and variability. This approach offers a clearer understanding of data distribution relative to key statistics.

### 2.4 Time Series Analysis
•	Reasoning: Analyzing data over time can reveal trends and patterns.
o	Minute-level Aggregation: Aggregating data by minute captures fine-grained temporal patterns.
o	Rolling Mean Smoothing: This technique smooths out short-term fluctuations, highlighting longer-term trends.
o	Dual y-axis Plots: These plots allow simultaneous visualization of two related metrics (e.g., blood glucose levels and insulin doses), facilitating trend comparison.
o	Vertical Lines for Meal Times: Adding vertical lines for standard meal times provides context, helping to identify correlations between meal times and changes in glucose or insulin levels.

## 3. Regression Analysis
### 3.1 Data Merging and Feature Engineering
•	Reasoning: Merging blood glucose and insulin data combines relevant information for a comprehensive analysis. Feature engineering creates new variables to improve the predictive power of the model.
o	Day of the Week and Hour of the Day: These features capture temporal patterns in glucose and insulin levels.
o	Lag Features: Introducing lagged values captures temporal dependencies, enabling the model to recognize trends over time.

### 3.2 Correlation Analysis
•	Reasoning: A correlation matrix quantifies linear relationships between variables. Visualizing this matrix with a heatmap helps identify strongly correlated variables, which is valuable for feature selection and understanding data relationships.

### 3.3 Data Preparation for Modeling
I divided the dataset into training and testing subsets. The training set was used to train the model, while the testing set was reserved for evaluating its performance. I typically used an 80-20 split, where 80% of the data was used for training and 20% for testing. This step was crucial for assessing how well the model generalized to unseen data.
•	Reasoning: Preparing the data involves several steps:
o	Feature and Target Selection: Identifying input features and the target variable is crucial for model training.
o	Train-Test Split: Splitting the data ensures model evaluation on unseen data, providing a more accurate assessment of performance.
o	Imputation of Missing Values: Imputing missing values prevents data loss and ensures complete data for training.
o	Standardization: Standardizing features ensures they have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, which is important for models sensitive to input data scale.
3.4 Model Training and Evaluation
I started with linear regression due to its simplicity and interpretability. I trained the model using the training data. Depending on the complexity of the problem, I also considered more advanced regression techniques such as Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree, or Random Forest regressors.
I evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²). These metrics provided insights into how well the model's predictions matched the actual values. I made predictions on the test set and compared these predictions with the true values to assess the model's accuracy and identify any potential areas for improvement.
•	Reasoning: Training and evaluating multiple models allows comparison of different algorithms.
o	Linear Regression: Serves as a baseline model with a simple linear relationship.
o	Random Forest Regression: Captures non-linear relationships and feature interactions.
o	Support Vector Regression (SVR): Effective for high-dimensional data.
o	Neural Network: Captures complex non-linear patterns through interconnected layers.
o	Ridge and Lasso Regression: Regularized models that prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients.
3.5 Comparison of Models
•	Reasoning: Comparing model performance using metrics like MSE and R-squared helps in selecting the best model. Visualizing actual vs. predicted values allows qualitative assessment of accuracy. This comparison ensures the selection of a model that generalizes best to new data, providing the most accurate predictions.
