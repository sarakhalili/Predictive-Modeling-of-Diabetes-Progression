# Predictive Modeling of Diabetes Progression

This project aims to develop a predictive model for diabetes progression using machine learning techniques. By analyzing patient data, the model seeks to forecast the progression of diabetes, aiding in early intervention and personalized treatment plans.

## Overview

Diabetes is a chronic condition affecting millions worldwide. Predicting its progression can significantly enhance patient care by enabling timely medical interventions. This project utilizes a dataset containing various health metrics to train and evaluate machine learning models that predict the progression of diabetes in patients.

## Dataset

* **Source**: The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, specifically the Diabetes dataset.
* **Contents**: It includes features such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements.
* **Target Variable**: A quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

## Project Structure

* `Diabetes_Progression_Analysis_UCI_Diabetes.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
* `combined_diabetes_data.csv`: Original dataset combining relevant features.
* `combined_diabetes_data_cleaned.csv`: Cleaned dataset after preprocessing steps.
* `README.md`: Project documentation.
